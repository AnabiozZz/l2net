3.07.2013: Fixed IS_RED
		   Fixed Karma display on Char Info Tab, Now shows absolute negative value instead of positive million.
		   (Note: Cannot use uint to display/parse karma value, breaks is_red and displays karma incorrectly)
		   Found OC overflow bug with transformations, Causes L2Net to crash when untransforming, will try to replicate at later date.
		   Updated Language Files from Karma to Reputation.
		   Modified Char_status_new_god.bmp (char status tab background image) to correct Karma heading to Reputation.
